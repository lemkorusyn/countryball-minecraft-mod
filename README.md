# COUNTRYBALL MINECRAFT MOD
### What is the Countryball Minecraft Mod?
This mod is a very simple mod that adds countryballs to minecraft. If you don't know what a countryball is, a short summary is that it's an art style where country flags are drawn on cirlces and you can animate or draw them in comics or little animations making fun of their country with political jokes.

There's a whole community built around this and it's been an art form that's been around for years.

### What exactly does it add?
It adds new mobs, countryballs, that walk and look around. They're very basic mobs, so they don't do anything special and they don't spawn naturally, you need to spawn them in with commands or spawn eggs.

### Does it change gameplay?
Not really, yet. Since you can only access them in creative, survival gameplay should be the same. However eventually they may begin spawning naturally in the world with their own strucutres and individual behaviors!|

### What countries are in the mod?
So far, only a few: China, Germany, Russia, India and Spain, plus a [lemkoball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemko_Republic) named after me, the maker of this mod, and a base countryball that doesn't have any flag, it's just a blank canvas.

More countries will be added in the future. There are so little because different flags are harder to map onto the ball itself than others.

### What version of minecraft does it support, and does it need any dependencies?
This mod is available for Minecraft 1.21.1, and will continue to be updated as more versions come out. Currently it is not available for the snapshots.

The mod requires [Geckolib](https://github.com/bernie-g/geckolib) version 4.6.3 or higher, and the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/versions) 0.105 or higher (The dependency lists and their versions will always be updated as soon as possible).

### How do I download this mod?
The mod is available on github, and available on Modrinth and Curseforge.
